# Multi-Task-Learning-Projects

This repo contains a collection of my projects exploring Multi-Task Learning. Below are summaries of the projects with links to the respective repos

Multi-Task Learning GAN https://github.com/ConnorWatts/Multi-Task-GAN

Developed a MTL framework for image GANs. Demonstrated that by jointly learning image classification tasks the generator produces more realistic and diverse images. For a demonstation please see corresponding notebook. 

Multi-Task Learning to Improve Image Segmentation https://github.com/ConnorWatts/Multi-Task-Learning-for-Image-Seg

Developed a multi-head image-segmentation model based on ResUNet. Demonstrated that by simultaneously learning the minimum bounding box of the images the segmentation accuracy increases.

Multi-Task Learning for Song Genre Classification using Lyrics https://github.com/ConnorWatts/Multi-Task-Genre-Classification

Developed multi-head song genre-classification models based on CNN and BERT architectures. Demonstrated that, for both models, by simultaneously learning the emotions in the lyrics the classification accuracy improves.

Pytorch Implementation of Born Again Multi-Task Networks https://github.com/ConnorWatts/BAM-NLU

Translated the source code from [BAM! Born-Again Multi-task for Natural Language Understanding](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/bam) from Tensorflow v1 to PyTorch.
